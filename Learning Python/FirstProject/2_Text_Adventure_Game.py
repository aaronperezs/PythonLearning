# 2. Text-based Adventure Game

# This is a basic version of the Adventure game. 
# It is completely text-based. In this version of the game,
# users can move about through different rooms within
# a single setting, and based on the user input, 
# it will provide descriptions for each room. 
# This is one of the interesting python projects. 

# Movement direction is crucial here â€“ you must 
# create walls and set the directions in which 
# the users can move through the rooms, set 
# movement restrictions, and also include a 
# tracker that can track how far a user has 
# walked or moved in the game. Mentioning 
# Python projects can help your resume look 
# much more interesting than others.
